## Tutorials

I want to do a few tutorials. Here they are...

1. [Line 25: Flat Breadcrumbs](http://line25.com/tutorials/how-to-create-flat-style-breadcrumb-links-with-css) will be the first one.
2. [Line 25: Trendy Flat Nav](http://line25.com/tutorials/how-to-create-a-trendy-flat-style-nav-menu-in-css)
3. [Line 25: Pure CSS Dropdowns](http://line25.com/tutorials/how-to-create-a-pure-css-dropdown-menu)
4. [HTML Hamburger Icon](https://raygun.io/blog/2014/07/making-svg-html-burger-button/)

## Other things

I'm going to try and use the [DevTips Starter Pack](https://github.com/DevTips/DevTips-Starter-Kit) on this deal. I know I started with out it. But i'm going to try and convert this to Jekyll and use the starter pack. It should be fun.
